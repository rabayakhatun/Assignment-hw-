            <b>Prominent voice actors say they weren't told about a landmark deal setting out how voices generated by
                 artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in games. </b> <br>
                 <blockquote>It has been struck by US actors' union Sag-Aftra and AI firm Replica Studios.</blockquote>
                 <article>The union says it guarantees "fully informed consent and fair compensation" for its members.
                 
                 But many voice artists, who have long been concerned AI will replace them, have reacted with fury with one calling the deal "garbage."
                 
                 It comes after Sag-Aftra led a months-long strike in 2023 to fight for protections from film and television studios using AI.
                 
                 Many voice actors have suggested this new deal is at odds with the purpose of that industrial action, with Fallout and Mortal Kombat voice actor Sunil Malhotra saying he "sacrificed to strike half of last year to keep my profession alive, not shop around my AI replica".
                 
                 In a blog covering the announcement, Sag-Aftra said the deal was "approved by affected members of the union's voiceover performer community".
                 
                 "Recent developments in AI technology have underscored the importance of protecting the rights of voice talent, particularly as game studios explore more efficient ways to create their games," said the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.
                 
                 "With this agreement, we have achieved fully informed consent and fair compensation when it comes to the use of our members' voices and performances."
                 
                 But Steve Blum, a voice actor once credited by Guinness for being the most prolific in video games, said "nobody" he knew of had approved the deal.
